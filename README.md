A productivity web app that combines a To-Do List for task management and a Pomodoro Timer to improve focus and efficiency.
The project features two completely different UI styles for desktop and mobile, creating a dynamic and tailored user experience.  

##Features  
✅ To-Do List – Add, mark as complete, and delete tasks easily.

✅ Live Date Update – The date updates in real-time without page refresh.  
✅ Responsive Design – A unique style for desktop and mobile screens.  

⚠️ **Note:** The app does not have a backend, so tasks are lost when the page is refreshed.
